- The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
- IMPORTANT: If the Figma Dev Mode MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload
- IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided
- Use components from `/src/components` wherever available.
- Match Figma designs precisely.
- Replace hardcoded values with Figma design tokens.
- Adhere to WCAG accessibility standards.
- Document components thoroughly.
- Organize UI components in `/src/components`, and use inline styles only if absolutely necessary.
